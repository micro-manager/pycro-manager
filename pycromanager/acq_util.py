    Start a Java process that contains the neccessary libraries for pycro-manager to run,

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_time_points : int
        How many time points if it is a timelapse (Default value = None)
    time_interval_s : float
        the minimum interval between consecutive time points in seconds. Keep at 0 to go as
        fast as possible (Default value = 0)
    z_start : float
        z-stack starting position, in µm. If xyz_positions is given z_start is relative
        to the points' z position. (Default value = None)
    z_end : float
        z-stack ending position, in µm. If xyz_positions is given z_start is
        relative to the points' z position. (Default value = None)
    z_step : float
        step size of z-stack, in µm (Default value = None)
    channel_group : str
        name of the channel group (which should correspond to a config group in micro-manager) (Default value = None)
    channels : list of strings
        list of channel names, which correspond to possible settings of the config group
        (e.g. ['DAPI', 'FITC']) (Default value = None)
    channel_exposures_ms : list of floats or ints
        list of camera exposure times corresponding to each channel. The length of this list
        should be the same as the the length of the list of channels (Default value = None)
    xy_positions : arraylike
        N by 2 array where N is the number of XY stage positions, and the 2 are the X and Y
        coordinates (Default value = None)
    xyz_positions : arraylike
        N by 3 array where N is the number of XY stage positions, and the 3 are the X, Y and Z coordinates.
        If passed then z_start, z_end, and z_step will be relative to the z_position in xyz_positions. (Default value = None)
    z_positions : arraylike
        The z_positions for each xy point. Either 1D (shape: (N,) ) to specify the center z position for each xy point,
        or 2D (shape: (N, n_z) ) to fully specify the xyz points.
        If z_positions is 1D and z_start, z_end and z_step are not None then relative
        z_positions will be created using np.arange(z_position + z_start, z_position + z_end, z_step)
    order : str
        string that specifies the order of different dimensions. Must have some ordering of the letters
        c, t, p, and z. For example, 'tcz' would run a timelapse where z stacks would be acquired at each channel in
        series. 'pt' would move to different xy stage positions and run a complete timelapse at each one before moving
        to the next (Default value = 'tpcz')
    keep_shutter_open_between_channels : bool
        don't close the shutter in between channels (Default value = False)
    keep_shutter_open_between_z_steps : bool
        don't close the shutter during steps of a z stack (Default value = False)
